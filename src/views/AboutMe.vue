        I'm The Ton Le or Tony, a New Zealand based web developer with over 2 years of experience. I specialise in front-end and back-end development with a

        I've been working at Jayden Digital Ltd for almost 2 years as a Web Developer Lead. Working at JDL is a great pleasure to me because I could work to
        work with Vue.js, React.js, Node.js, etc. and I'm very excited to continue learning and improving my skills.
